# surfs_up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use SQLite to conduct weather analysis and find precipitation patterns, and to create a Flask application to display the results, to determine whether the weather in Oahu would permit opening a surf shop. I then sought after temperature data for the months of June and December.

## Results
Here are the final summary statistics for the months of June and December:

Based on these tables we can conclude that:
- The average temperature in June is about 75 degrees while in December it is 71
- The minimum temperature in June is about 64 degrees while in December it is 56
- The maximum temperature in June is about 85 degrees while in December it is 83

## Summary
Even though the weather tends to drop a bit in December, it seems unlikely that there will be a large change of rainfall. Therefore, based on these results, it is resonable to conclude that it would be possible to open a surfshop year round.
